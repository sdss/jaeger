# Changelog

## Next release

### ðŸš€ New

* [#96](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/85) Raise error if sending a bootloader command while not in bootloader mode.
* [#109](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/109) Added JSON schema for the actor.
* [#97](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/97) Implement low temperature handling. When the air temperature is less than 0 degrees, the motor RPM is set to 3000. When the temperature is less than -10, the beta motor holding current is increased to 30%.
* [#15](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/15) Allow to disable a positioner. If the positioner is disabled, a non-safe command sent to the FPS will raise an error. In `send_to_all`, a broadcast will be only sent to the non-disabled positioners. Trajectories that include disabled positioners will fail.
* [#116](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/116) Safe mode to prevent the beta arm to go below 160 degrees.

### ðŸ§¹ Cleanup

* [#96](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/96) Discontinue the use of `sdsscore`. Improved the handling of user configuration files.
* [#95](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/95) Support Python 3.9.
* Require `drift>=0.2.2` to fix a bug in setting the relay values.
