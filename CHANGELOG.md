# Changelog

## Next version

### ðŸš€ New

* [#163](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/163) The to and from destination trajectories are saved when `BaseConfiguration.get_trajectory()` is called. The reverse path can be sent from the actor using `configuration reverse`. The paths can be generated in advance when loading the design.


### âœ¨ Improved

* Snapshots are run in a process pool executor and are saved automatically at the end of a trajectory or when `TrajectoryError` is raised.


## 0.12.0 - November 28, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* Code to load robostrategy designs to `targetdb` and create configurations. Added actor commands to use `kaiju` to calculate and send a valid trajectory and to unwind, explode, and send a random configuration to the array.
* [#153](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/153) Handling of low temperature now happens in `FPS` instead of in the actor. Added an `FPS.status` attribute with the global status of the system (idle, moving, collided, and temperature status). The actor subscribes to status changes using `FPS.async_status()` and broadcasts them.
* Add `FPS.save_snapshot()` along with actor command `snapshot` to use kaiju to save a plot with the current arrangement of the FPS array.
* Add a lockfile to prevent multiple instance of `jaeger` running at the same time. At the observatories, `jaeger` can only run on `sdss5-fps`.
* All functions that call CPU-intensive methods in `kaiju` are now run in a `ProcessPool` executor.
* FVC loop is now functional.

### âœ¨ Improved

* [#157](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/157) Prevents clearing the collided flags when the array is stopped during a collision or when initialised. Issues `SEND_TRAJECTORY_ABORT` instead of `STOP_TRAJECTORY`. They both stop all the positioners but the former does not clear the collided status flags.
* Added additional checks to confirm that a trajectory starts correctly and succeeds. After one second, the code checks that the FPS is moving and that `DISPLACEMENT_COMPLETED` is not present on any positioner status. At the end of the trajectory a check confirms that all the positioners are within 0.1 degrees of their destinations.
* Add `--no-gfas` to the `ieb power on` command to avoid powering the GFAs during the power on sequence.
* Allows to call `FVC.expose()` without an active command by creating an ad-hoc Tron connection.
* `FVC.expose()` now can stack multiple exposures.
* Allows to use fibre_type other than 'Metrology' when processing an FVC image.
* Defaults to `proc-<image>` when calling `FVC.write_proc_image()`.


## 0.11.0 - October 12, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* [#152](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/pull/152) FVC IEB support and actor commands.
* Add commands `GET_HALL_CALIB_ERROR`, `GET_ALPHA_HALL_CALIB`, and `GET_BETA_HALL_CALIB` for hall sensor calibration querying.
* The actor status command now returns the number of trajectories executed.

### âœ¨ Improved

* Add `Trajectory.start_time` and `Trajectory.end_time` that can be used to determine when the trajectory failed. `send_trajectory` now allows to return the unsent or non-started trajectory.
* When running the actor as a daemon in detached mode, log stdout and stderr to file.
* By default, do not fail when a command receives an `UNKNOWN_COMMAND` reply; this usually means that the positioner firmware does not support that command yet. This can be disabled by initialising the `Command` with `ignore_unknown=False`.
* It's now possible to switch the SYNC line relay (`ieb switch sync`). The SYNC line may be left closed if there's an uncaught exception while it's being actuated, or if the script is killed during that time. This allows to restore it to open.
* `TrajectoryError` now includes the original `Trajectory` object as `TrajectoryError.trajectory`.
* `FPS.send_trajectory()` now raises a `TrajectoryError` if it fails.
* Better logging of the reason for failure in `Trajectory`. In particular, `Trajectory.failed_positioners` contains a dictionary with the reason why a give positioner failed to receive or execute the trajectory, if that information is known.

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

* Avoid clipping the current position to `(0, 360)` when calculating the trajectory in `goto()`. This prevents using `goto()` when the positioner is at a negative position.


## 0.10.0 - August 3, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* [#149](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/149) Added an `FPS.goto()` method that sends a list of positioners to a given position using trajectories. By default `Positioner.goto()` now also uses trajectories, but `GOTO_ABSOLUTE_POSITION` can still be used.
* [#150](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/150) Allow to skip positioners that are connected to the bus but that we want to ignore. Also allow to disable collision detection for a list of positioners. See configuration options `fps.skip_positioners` and `fps.disable_collision_detection_positioners`.

### âœ¨ Improved

* `Trajectory()` now sends data points using a single command per trajectory chunk.
* Warn about individual replies that return without `COMMAND_ACCEPTED`.
* Remove check for whether a positioner has started to move after sending the goto command. It sometimes produced false positives on very short moves.
* Disable precise moves by default.
* Improve reloading the FPS.
* Remove `bootloader` commands from actor.
* `FPS.locked_by` now reports what positioner id(s) locked the FPS on a collision.
* Actor `ieb fbi` now accepts multiple devices.
* Use coil space for IEB relays.
* Use 8 message per positioner by default when upgrading the firmware.

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

* When sending multiple message per positioner per command, assign different UIDs.
* Fix address of IEB RTD12.
* Fix upgrade firmware script in the case of a single test sextant.
* Turn off all sextants before upgrading the firmware.
* Fixed and tested the power on and power off IEB sequences.


## 0.9.0 - July 18, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* [#131](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/131) **Breaking change**. This version includes a major rewrite of the internals of `Command` and how it is used throughout `jaeger`. In addition to acception a single `positioner_id`, `Command` can now receive a list of positioners to command. When the command is awaited it will wait until all the positioners have replied or the command has timed out. For the most part this is equivalent to using the old `FPS.send_to_all()` which has now been deprecated, but with the advantage that a single `Future` is created. This seems to significantly decrease the overhead that `asyncio` introduces when creating and await many tasks. `FPS.send_command()` now also accepts a list of positioners, thus replacing `send_to_all()`. For the most part low level initialisation of commands, as long as they are used to address a single positioner, should not have changed. To address multiple positioners at once use `send_command()`.
* [#127](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/127) Implemented positioner LED on/off commands.
* [#128](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/128) Deprecated the use of `python-can` buses since they block in a non-asynchronous way. This caused significant inefficiencies when controller >200 robots, especially on computers with old CPUs. This PR implements the major changes, including refacting `JaegerCAN` and `FPS` to initialise the buses asynchronously, and a reimplementation of `CANNetBus`, `VirtualBus`, and `Notifier`. This PR also includes some general performance gains such as a better implementation of `parse_identifier`.
* [#134](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/134) Added a new actor command `reload` that will reinitialise the `FPS` instance and reload any new robots after a sextant power cycle.
* [#142](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/142) Added an `ieb info` actor command to show information about the IEB layout to users.
* [#119](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/119) Allow to manually add and initialise a single positioner.

### âœ¨ Improved

* [#135](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/135) Cleaned up initialisation methods for `JaegerCAN` and `FPS`. Objects can now be instantiated and initialised at the same time using the async classmethod `.create()`.
* [#141](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/141) The `jaeger upgrade-firmware` command will now upgrade the firmware of one sextant at a time to avoid powering on too many power supplies at the same time.
* [#124](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/124) Collisions are handled better. If a move command is running when the FPS is locked, the command is cancelled. `Postioner.goto()` and `send_trajectory()` now continuously check if the FPS has been locked during the move. If it is, they fail in a non-verbose way. `FPS.send_trajectory()` now logs an error but doesn't raise an exception if the trajectory fails.

### ðŸ§¹ Cleaned

* [#129](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/129) Removed the use of the database and predefined layouts for the FPS. Default mode is that positioners are always auto-discovered.
* [#133](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/133) Completely removed the use of `python-can`. A conditional import is done for the `slcan` and `socketcan` interfaces for which `python-can` does need to be installed.
* [#130](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/130) Removed engineering mode.
* [#132](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/132) Merged `JagerCAN._send_commands()` and `.send_to_interfaces()` into `JaegerCAN.send_commands()`. Renamed `FPS.send_command()` `synchronous` parameter to `now`.


## 0.8.0 - June 21, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* [#122](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/122) Precise moves can now be disabled for all positioners by setting the configuration parameter `positioner.disable_precise_moves`. Also implements the CAN commands `SWITCH_[ON|OFF]_PRECISE_MOVE_[ALPHA|BETA]`.
* New `debug` parameter in the configuration file. If it is `false`, some warnings will be silenced and `JaegerCAN` will not log to `can.log`.
* [#126](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/126) Use [furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/) Sphinx theme. Add `noxfile` for `sphinx-autobuild`.

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

* Bug preventing the FPS from being initialised when upgrading the firmware if one was not power cycling the electronics from software.

### âœ¨ Improved

* Improved the performance when upgrading the firmware. When calling `load_firmware` one can specify how many ``messages_per_positioner`` to send at once. Too many messages at once will overflow the buffer, but the right number can optimise performance. By default, logging to the CAN log will be suspended during the firmware upgrade to boost performance.


## 0.7.0 - May 24, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* [#96](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/85) Raise error if sending a bootloader command while not in bootloader mode.
* [#109](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/109) Added JSON schema for the actor.
* [#97](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/97) Implement low temperature handling. When the air temperature is less than 0 degrees, the motor RPM is set to 3000. When the temperature is less than -10, the beta motor holding current is increased to 30%.
* [#15](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/15) Allow to disable a positioner. If the positioner is disabled, a non-safe command sent to the FPS will raise an error. In `send_to_all`, a broadcast will be only sent to the non-disabled positioners. Trajectories that include disabled positioners will fail.
* [#116](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/116) Safe mode to prevent the beta arm to go below 160 degrees.

### âœ¨ Improved

* [#121](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/121) Improve the use of the database to define the FPS layout.

### ðŸ§¹ Cleanup

* [#96](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/96) Discontinue the use of `sdsscore`. Improved the handling of user configuration files.
* [#95](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/issues/95) Support Python 3.9.
* Require `drift>=0.2.2` to fix a bug in setting the relay values.
* Stop using `releases` for the changelog and migrate to using [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sdss/jaeger/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). Release information for previous version is available [here](https://sdss-jaeger.readthedocs.io/en/0.6.0/changelog.html).
