class Command(StatusMixIn, asyncio.Future):
    """A command to be sent to the CAN controller.

    Implements a base class to define CAN commands to interact with the
    positioner. Commands can be composed of single or multiple messages.
    When sending a command to the bus, the first message is written to,
    then asynchronously waits for a confirmation that the message has been
    received before sending the following message. If any of the messages
    returns an error code the command is failed.

    `.Command` subclasses from `.StatusMixIn` and `.status_callback` gets
    called when the status changes.

    `.Command` is a `~asyncio.Future` and must be awaited. The
    `~asyncio.Future` is done when `~.Command.finish_command` is called,
    which happens when the status is marked done or cancelled or when the
    command timeouts.

    Commands sent to a single positioner are marked done when a reply is
    received from the same positioner for the given command, or when it
    times out. Broadcast commands only get marked done by timing out or
    manually.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positioner_id : int or list
        The id or list of ids of the robot(s) to which this command will be
        sent. Use ``positioner_id=0`` to broadcast to all robots.
    loop : event loop
        The running event loop, or uses `~asyncio.get_event_loop`.
    timeout : float
        Time after which the command will be marked done. Note that if the
        command is not a broadcast and it receives replies to each one of the
        messages it sends, the command will be marked done and the timer
        cancelled. If negative, the command runs forever or until all the
        replies have been received.
    done_callback : function
        A function to call when the command has been successfully completed.
    n_positioners : int
        If the command is a broadcast, the number of positioners that should
        reply. If defined, the command will be done once as many positioners
        have replied. Otherwise it waits for the command to time out.
    data : list
        The data to pass to the messages. It must be a list in which each
        element is the payload for a message. As many messages as data elements
        will be sent. If `None`, a single message without payload will be sent.
